## Project Overview
TeosNexus is a groundbreaking Web3 social platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with cultural preservation, specifically designed to operate on the Solana blockchain. The platform leverages Solana's high-performance capabilities, which support thousands of transactions per second with fees remaining less than $0.0025, to create a decentralized social network that empowers users through tokenized engagement and cultural heritage preservation. The platform introduces its native cryptocurrency, $TEOS Egypt, enabling direct monetization opportunities for creators and community members while celebrating Egyptian heritage and expanding globally.

Traditional social media platforms often suffer from privacy invasions, data breaches, lack of financial compensation for users, and an absence of meaningful cultural integration. TeosNexus addresses these critical limitations by offering a transparent, user-controlled environment where individuals truly own their content, data, and social connections. It provides a unique value proposition by combining traditional social media functionalities with robust blockchain capabilities, prioritizing user sovereignty, transparent monetization, and community governance.

## Core Features
TeosNexus is designed with a suite of features to deliver a comprehensive and engaging Web3 social experience:

*   **Web3 Authentication System (F-001):** A secure, decentralized identity management system leveraging Solana's blockchain capabilities. It enables seamless wallet-based login and provides users with complete ownership and control over their digital identity, integrating with popular wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Phantom Wallet.

*   **Decentralized Social Feed (F-002):** A real-time content feed that combines traditional social media interactions with blockchain transparency. Users maintain true ownership of their social content and connections, benefiting from algorithmic transparency and direct monetization through engagement.

*   **Content Creation and Publishing (F-003):** A comprehensive suite supporting multimedia formats and NFT minting. This feature empowers creators with direct monetization opportunities and ensures content authenticity and ownership through immutable content verification and tracking, utilizing IPFS and Arweave for permanent storage.

*   **Token-Based Engagement System (F-004):** Integration of the native $TEOS Egypt token to reward user engagement, content creation, and community participation. This system creates sustainable economic incentives and provides transparent reward mechanisms, leveraging Solana's low transaction fees.

*   **NFT Marketplace (F-005):** An integrated marketplace for cultural artifacts and digital collectibles. It features smart contract automation for royalty distribution and authenticity verification, allowing creators to generate revenue and collectors to acquire verified digital assets.

*   **DAO Governance System (F-006):** A community-driven governance model where all major and minor platform changes are subject to community voting. This ensures transparent decision-making processes and allows token holders to participate directly in the platform's evolution.

*   **Cross-Chain Interoperability (F-007):** Multi-blockchain support enabling seamless interaction with Ethereum, Pi Network, and Polygon ecosystems, while maintaining Solana as the primary blockchain for optimal performance. This expands the user base and enhances token utility across different networks.

*   **Cultural Heritage Preservation (F-008):** A blockchain-based system for protecting cultural heritage. It facilitates revenue collection for preservation efforts and converts heritage objects into NFTs with metadata stored on IPFS, ensuring their immutable documentation and protection.

## Technology Stack
TeosNexus is built using a robust and modern technology stack designed for performance, scalability, and Web3 compatibility:

### Programming Languages
*   **TypeScript (5.3+):** Used for the Web Application Frontend and API Services. Provides type safety and enhanced developer experience, crucial for complex Web3 integrations.
*   **JavaScript (ES2023+):** Utilized for browser runtime interactions, especially for Web3 wallet integrations and blockchain interactions where TypeScript compilation is not available.
*   **Rust (1.75+):** The primary language for developing Solana programs (smart contracts). Chosen for its performance and suitability for blockchain operations.
*   **Solidity (0.8.20+):** Native smart contract language for Solana blockchain development, used in conjunction with Rust and C programming languages.

### Blockchain and Decentralized Technologies
*   **Solana Blockchain:** The core blockchain for primary operations, chosen for its high-performance capabilities (400ms block times, thousands of transactions per second, low fees).
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) & Arweave:** Used for decentralized content storage, ensuring permanent accessibility and immutability of user-generated content and NFT metadata.
*   **MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom Wallet:** Integrated for comprehensive wallet authentication and seamless user onboarding.
*   **The Graph:** For blockchain data indexing, enabling efficient querying of on-chain data.

### Other Technologies
*   **React.js:** The frontend framework for building the web-based platform, with extensive Web3 integration libraries.
*   **MongoDB Atlas:** Used for off-chain application state management.

## Getting Started
To set up the TeosNexus development environment and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Git:** [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **Node.js & npm (or yarn):** For frontend development.
*   **Rust & Cargo:** For Solana program development.
*   **Solana Tool Suite:** For interacting with the Solana blockchain.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd TeosNexus
    ```
    Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of the TeosNexus Git repository.

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Solana Program Dependencies (Rust):**
    ```bash
    cd program
    cargo build
    ```

### Running the Project
Detailed instructions for running specific components will be provided in their respective subdirectories. Generally, you will:

1.  **Start Solana local validator (for local development):**
    ```bash
    solana-test-validator
    ```

2.  **Deploy Solana programs:**
    ```bash
    solana program deploy target/deploy/teosnexus_program.so
    ```

3.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
